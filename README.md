## ⚡ Overview

**FileDrop** is a modern desktop app that lets you send and receive files instantly across devices on the same local network — without needing internet, third-party servers, or configuration.

Designed for privacy, built with performance in mind, and crafted in Rust for maximum reliability.

## 🧠 Why FileDrop?

- ✅ **Fast** – transfers large files in seconds using direct TCP
- 🔒 **Private** – your files never leave your network
- 🖥️ **Cross-platform** – built in Rust, runs on Windows, macOS, Linux
- 🌐 **Zero config** – just launch, select, and send
- 🧊 **Lightweight** – no Electron bloat, native GUI with `egui`
- 💾 **Offline** – works perfectly without an internet connection
